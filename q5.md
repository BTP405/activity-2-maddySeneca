Q1.
#Approach 1 - 
This approach creates an empty list res and then it appends the double of the numbers in the range 1 to n and then returns the whole list. After that in the for loop below the function is called. In this way, the whole function runs first and returns a list. After which the for loop runs on the return value of the function (list returned in this case).

#Approach 2 - 
In this method, we are not defining any functions. In this method, directly in the for loop we use list comprehension. This can be seen as in the for loop itself, a list is made on the basis of the for loop running inside the [](square) brackets. In this case, n*2 is being added to the list for the range given an then the outer for loop iterates over this list to give us the final output. This method is faster than the previous one.

#Approach 3 -
This approach seems to be similar to the first one, however it is a bit different. In this approach we are using generator function which is the doubleG function. We can notice how the function doesnt return, instead it uses the yield keyword. This yield keyword basically gives a value to the iteration that is running. So what happens is that the iteratio is run and it calls the function for the first time; then the function runs and yields a value to the iteration for it to print. During this process the function is paused. Then we come to the function again for the second value, this again yields a value to the iteration and the loop prints the element while the function still waits. This is better and efficient because here we are not allocating any extra memory for the list to be returned as done in approach 1.

Q2.
doubleG function is a generator function. It is a function in python that can be made by using the yield keyword. As used in approach 3, this generator function is very helpful as it helps us to yield a value to the iterable one by one, instead of running the whole function all together and returning a specific object. As previously stated, this is better and efficient as it doesnot require memory allocation because we are not returning a specific list, rather we are yielding the elements to the iterable one by one. These functions retain previous states and they do not run from the start when called again by the iterable.
